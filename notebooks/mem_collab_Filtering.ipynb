    "This notebook explores **memory-based collaborative filtering** as a first baseline for building a movie recommendation system. The approach relies solely on the raw user–item rating matrix, without the need for training or any machine learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is to build recommendations based on similarities, which can be computed in two main ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User–User Collaborative Filtering**: recommends movies liked by users who have similar preferences and rating behavior to us.\n",
    "- **Item–Item Collaborative Filtering**: recommends new movies that are similar to the ones we have already seen and liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To define similarities between users or items, we commonly use two metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: a fast and popular measure that computes the angle between two vectors (single users or items). The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{sim}_{\\text{cosine}}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\|x\\| \\|y\\|}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pearson Correlation**: more computationally demanding, but it measures the linear relationship between co-rated items, correcting for each user’s individual rating bias. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{sim}_{\\text{pearson}}(x, y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i}(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\sqrt{\\sum(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its ability to correct for individual rating biases, Pearson correlation is especially useful in user–user collaborative filtering, where users may have very different rating scales. In item–item collaborative filtering, this adjustment is less critical, and both Pearson and cosine similarity often produce similar results, particularly in sparse datasets."
